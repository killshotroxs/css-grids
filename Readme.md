## Responsive CSS Grid Outline


### Description

This project is a responsive CSS Grid outline that renders a different background color depending on the device theme, whether it is set to Dark or Light. It utilizes CSS Grid to create a flexible and adaptive layout for various screen sizes, ensuring optimal user experience across devices.

### Features

Responsive CSS Grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
Detects the user's preferred color scheme (Dark or Light) using the device theme settings.
Renders a distinct background color based on the detected theme to provide a consistent and visually pleasing experience.
How It Works

The project uses CSS Grid properties to define a multi-column layout for various elements. It leverages the prefers-color-scheme media query to detect the user's preferred color scheme. When the device theme is set to Dark, the grid renders with a set of background colors optimized for a darker theme. Similarly, when the device theme is set to Light, the grid adapts to display a different set of background colors suitable for a lighter theme.

### Usage

Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Observe the responsive CSS Grid outline and notice how the background colors change based on your device's theme settings.
Browser Compatibility

This project is designed to be compatible with modern web browsers that support CSS Grid and the prefers-color-scheme media query. Ensure you are using an up-to-date browser version for the best experience.
